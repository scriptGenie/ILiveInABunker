ILiveInABunker is a idle-ish rpg set in a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland. Resources are scarce, and retrieving them from the wastes is a gamble every time.

Players will control one or more Bunkers, sites (usually underground) that have managed to stay in a somewhat habitable condition despite the world falling apart. These Bunkers can range from semi-shielded train cars some prepper stuffed in the side of a mountain, to full-on nuclear fallout shelters designed for long-term habitation.

As is life, most things are random. You could start comfortable and stay comfortable, or claw your way to stability from a lead-lined root cellar.

TODO. For now any interest is welcome and appreciated. Feel free to tinker and make pull requests. Please include detailed comments and such.

You'll need to follow the discordjs guide for creating a bot and adding it to a server for testing. Project is currently set up to utilize a .env file setup with {token}, {guildId}, and {clientId} in the following format:

- token="YOUR-TEXT-HERE"
- guildId="YOUR-TEXT-HERE"
- clientId=="YOUR-TEXT-HERE"


If you're new to contributing (like myself!) head over to [Issue #1](https://github.com/scriptGenie/ILiveInABunker/issues/1) and make a pull request to get started (Downloading/Running the project is not required to work on this issue.).
